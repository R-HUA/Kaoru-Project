				<h2 style="font-size:24px;font-style:normal;font-weight:700;line-height:1.2;">Why this animal lacks
					biosecurity and is at risk of extinction?</h2>
				<p>There are two major factors contributing to the tigers’ risk of extinction, which are poaching and
					habitat loss.
				<p>
				<h3 style="font-size:20px;font-style:normal;font-weight:700;text-align: left;padding:0 0 0 1.5em">
					Poaching </h3>
				<p> The poaching of tigers is the largest factor contributing to the endangerment of tigers, it has
					significantly increased since the 90’s <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>. Tiger parts, such as bones and
					skin, are often traded in the black market and transnational crime syndicates can make a large
					profit from tiger parts due to persistent demand, mainly caused by their use in traditional Asian
					medicines <sup>[2]</sup>, <sup>[3]</sup>.
				</p>
				<h3 style="font-size:20px;font-style:normal;font-weight:700;text-align: left;padding:0 0 0 1.5em;">
					Habitat Loss </h3>
				<p> Loss of habitat is primarily caused by direct and indirect human interference. Deforestation, for
					purposes such as gathering timber and building new structures including roads and buildings, has
					caused an estimated loss of 95% according to <sup>[2]</sup>. Climate change is also a factor
					contributing to habitat loss. Rising sea levels risk destroying forests where tigers make their home
					<sup>[2]</sup>.

				<h2>What are its welfare needs (nutrition, health, environment, behaviour, mental state)?
				</h2>
				<p>The following points refer to requirements needed for tigers’ welfare:</p>
				<p> ● Tigers are Asia’s largest species of big cats, an apex predator native to rainforests, grasslands
					and mangrove swamps located in countries such as China, India, Indonesia, North Korea and Russia
					<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>.
				</p>
				<p> ● They need a large, sufficient amount of space to themselves, because they are solitary animals and
					are highly territorial <sup>[2]</sup>.
				</p>
				<p> ● They are carnivores, their common prey are larger animals, including deer and boar <sup>[1]</sup>.
				</p>
				<p> ● Stimulation is required to enhance their welfare, especially since they are hunters/predators.
				</p>
				<p> ● They are fond of bathing and are adept at swimming, which may be caused by their lower tolerance
					of heat. They therefore require a pool of water to soak in <sup>[1]</sup>.

				<h2>How this animal would experience what it experiences in a zoo, (such as solitary or herd
					preferences)

				</h2>
				<p> A tiger is often given an enclosure to themselves, due to their solitary nature <sup>[1]</sup>.
					Their enclosures are made as large as possible, and vegetation is used to accommodate them by
					simulating their natural habitat. Stimulation is provided to them through their environment and
					toys. Their enclosures can contain ledges and waterfalls, and toys are provided in order to enrich
					them and cater to their natural instincts <sup>[2]</sup>. Due to their fondness of bathing and
					swimming, a zoo may include a large pool of water in their enclosure <sup>[1]</sup>. Behaviors such
					as pacing are often a sign of stress for tigers in captivity, as this is not normally present with
					tigers in the wild <sup>[2]</sup>. This can be caused by factors such as lack of stimulation and
					enrichment in their environment (e.g. lack of space, vegetation, toys, etc) <sup>[2]</sup>.

				<h2>What conditions are needed for successful captive breeding?</h2>
				<p>Tigers can breed during all periods of the year, however, their peak seasons are between March to
					June, and September <sup>[1]</sup>. For females, tigers reach sexual maturity when they are between
					three and four years old, and males mature between four and five years old <sup>[2]</sup>. In the
					wild, tigers are individualistic, it is believed that males and females only meet together to breed
					<sup>[1]</sup>. According to <sup>[2]</sup>, female tigers often birth two to four cubs every two
					years. Mother tigers and their cubs have close relationships, and cubs often do not leave their
					mother until they reach around two years old, when they are old enough to hunt on their own
					<sup>[3]</sup>. In captivity, it is challenging to breed tigers because of their solitary nature.
					Firstly, tigers should not be kept in large groups. For example, they can be kept in pairs (one male
					and one female) or small groups (just one male with more than one female) to allow for mating
					<sup>[4]</sup>. Then, it is important that mother tigers are given privacy and be isolated from the
					public a few months after getting pregnant <sup>[4]</sup>. Once the cubs are born, they should be
					kept with their mothers for several months and be given vaccines to protect them from diseases such
					as feline panleukopenia <sup>[4]</sup>. Mother tigers should also be provided with a variety of
					food, including extra vitamins and minerals, and fresh air <sup>[4]</sup>.

				<h2>What has been done to promote awareness of this animal to the general public?
				</h2>
				<p>The following are several ways people and organizations have promoted awareness for the tiger:
					Several charities and organizations accept donations in order to support the welfare of tigers. For
					example, the WWF allows people to ‘adopt’ a tiger. People can choose an amount to donate monthly,
					which will go towards their protection <sup>[1]</sup>.
					Not only exclusive to tigers, but zoos and wildlife sanctuaries provide a place for the general
					public to learn and observe them in person. Some zoos offer encounters, which allow visitors to get
					the opportunity to meet a tiger in real life.
					International Tiger Day is hosted by the WWF every July 29th, founded in 2010 when the TX2 program
					was started <sup>[2]</sup>. Its purpose is to raise awareness about the tiger on a global scale.

				<h2>Who are some current contributors to this animals’ conservation?</h2>
				<p>The following are several contributors to the conservation of tigers:
					The WWF started the TX2 program, which stands for ‘Tigers times two,’ in 2010. The goal is to double
					the population of tigers, which was 3200 during 2010, by 2022, which happens to be the Chinese year
					of the tiger <sup>[1]</sup>.
					Panthera created the Tigers Forever campaign. Located across several sites in Asia, in the countries
					“Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand” <sup>[2]</sup>, their aim is to
					increase the population of tigers in each site by at least 50%. They aim to do this by focusing on
					the two major threats to the extinction of their species, poaching and habitat loss <sup>[2]</sup>.
					The Indian government launched Project Tiger in 1973 <sup>[3]</sup>. They declared several areas of
					high biodiversity value as national parks, tigers’ natural habitat, in order to eliminate human
					interferences such as poaching and settlement and encourage ecosystems to restore their balance
					<sup>[3]</sup>.
					Zoos Victoria have a Captive Breeding Program for tigers. Tigers are also involved in their ‘Don’t
					Palm Us Off’ campaign <sup>[4]</sup>. Palm oils are a major contributor to biodiversity loss, as the
					collection of palm oils contributes to deforestation, destroying animals’ (such as the Sumatran
					tiger) natural habitat <sup>[4]</sup>. Their goal is to introduce a law in Australia that requires
					products to clearly outline whether they contain palm oil, to let the public be aware of what they
					buy. and hopefully reduce the number of these products being sold.
